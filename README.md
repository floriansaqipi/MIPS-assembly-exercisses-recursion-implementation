# MIPS Assembly Language Exercises

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to learners and enthusiasts of computer architecture, specifically those interested in diving deep into the MIPS assembly language. It encompasses a wide range of exercises aimed at providing a hands-on experience with various aspects of assembly language programming. Through these exercises, learners can grasp the intricacies of MIPS and develop a solid understanding of low-level programming concepts.

### Topics Covered:

- **Working with Strings:** Manipulating character arrays to perform operations such as copying, reversing, and comparing strings.
- **Integers & Arithmetic:** Operations involving integers, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Conditionals:** Implementing if-else statements and switch-case constructs to control the flow of programs.
- **Loops:** Writing for and while loops to perform iterative operations.
- **Stack Manipulation:** Understanding how to use the stack for storing temporary variables and managing function calls.
- **Functions:** Creating reusable code blocks for common mathematical functions such as factorial and power calculations.
- **Recursion:** A final project that demonstrates the use of recursion in MIPS, particularly focusing on challenges like preserving temporary variable states and managing return addresses in the stack.

## Requirements

To engage with the exercises in this repository, you will need:

- **QTSpim Software:** All the assembly files (.asm) are designed to be executed using the QTSpim simulator, a software tool that simulates the MIPS32 architecture. Make sure to have QTSpim installed on your machine. QTSpim can be downloaded from [the official website](http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/).

## How to Run the Programs

1. **Install QTSpim:** Ensure that QTSpim is installed on your computer.
2. **Clone the Repository:** Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
3. **Open QTSpim:** Launch the QTSpim application.
4. **Load the Assembly File:** In QTSpim, open the assembly file (.asm) you wish to run from the repository.
5. **Execute the Program:** Follow QTSpim's interface to initialize and run the program. You can step through the code to observe how each instruction is executed, which is particularly useful for educational purposes.

## Documentation

Alongside the exercise files, this repository contains a detailed documentation file that describes the implementation of the final project. The documentation offers insights into the design decisions, challenges encountered, and solutions adopted, particularly in terms of recursion, stack management, and temporary variable state preservation.
